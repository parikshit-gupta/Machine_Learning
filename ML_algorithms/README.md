# Welcome to my machine learning journey!!!
- This repository contains implementation and visualisation of various machine learning algorithms using python libraries like NumPy, MatplotLib, Sci-Kit Learn and Pandas.
- It demonstrates my in-depth understanding of machine learning algorithms and ability to efficiently use NumPy to implement these algorithms.
- Each algoriothm has been implemented using the inbuilt functions and then using the NumPy implementation of those functions.
